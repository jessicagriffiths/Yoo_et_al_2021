We quantified the number of neurons and ganglia as well as the ganglion size (i.e., the number of neurons in each ganglion) in the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of seven regions of the SI and two regions of the colon of mice that recieved 10^12 vg of AAV-PHP.S-hSYN1-XFP. Regions were approximately 1 cm in length, and the tissue was sampled every 2â€“3 cm. We saw that, in the SI, the numbers of neurons and ganglia generally increased toward the distal portion of the myenteric plexus, while the converse was true for the submucosal plexus (i.e., lower numbers in distal than proximal regions). Additionally, the size of the ganglia (i.e., the number of neurons per ganglion) increased in the distal region of the SI myenteric plexus, a feature not observed in the submucosal plexus. While neuronal numbers were similar in the proximal and distal regions of the colonic plexuses, the number of myenteric ganglia increased while the size of each ganglion decreased in the distal colon.
