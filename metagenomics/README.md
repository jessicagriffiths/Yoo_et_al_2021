Fecal DNA was extracted with the Qiagen MagAttract PowerSoil DNA kit. The Illumina data for each HiSeq lane was uploaded to Qiita, a tool with standardized pipelines for processing and analyzing metagenomic data. Adapter sequences were removed from the reads using the Atropos v.1.1.15 command (from the qp-shogun 0.1.5 pipeline) and the trimmed sequences were downloaded from Qiita. The reads for each sample were filtered of any potential mouse contamination using Bowtie2 v.2â€“2.2.394. The filtered reads were then aligned to the Web of Life (WoL) reference phylogeny with Bowtie2 using an adapted SHOGUN pipeline.
