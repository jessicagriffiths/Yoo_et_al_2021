The untargeted metabolomics analysis was completed using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC) coupled to an ultra-high resolution quadrupole time of flight (qTOF) mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics MaXis HD). The raw.d data files were converted to mzXML format using Bruker Compass DataAnalysis 4.1 software. The resulting.mzXML file, the original.d file folders, and basic prep information sheet are stored in the UC San Diego MassIVE data repository under the accession number MSV000084550
